# Ad_Classification

Hockey vs Advertisement Classifier! 

This repository contains the code used to collect data, preprocess data, train a pytorch model, and make predictions on new images. Advertisements are distracting, and the objective of this project is to mute these advertisements when they come on and only unmute when the hockey game returns.

Note: Unfortunately I have not included the model weights due to it being trained on copyrighted material

## Use cases

The classifier has been set up to be executable on a [mac](./mac_inference)
or [raspberry pi](./pi_inference) (haven't bought an infrared remote for the pi to control a TV yet), where it mutes the TV/laptop when advertisements are on.
