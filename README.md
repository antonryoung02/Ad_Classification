# Ad_Classification
Note: Unfortunately I have not included the model weights due to it being trained on copyrighted material

## Motivation

Why are we paying streaming services to watch corporate short form content?

## Use cases

The classifier has been set up to be executable on a mac or raspberry pi (haven't bought an infrared remote for the pi to control a TV yet), where it mutes the TV/laptop when advertisements are on.

## Demos
