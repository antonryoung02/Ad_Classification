Note: Unfortunately I have not included the model weights due to it being trained on copyrighted material

## Motivation

## Use cases

The classifier has been set up to be executable on a [mac](./mac_inference)
or [raspberry pi](./pi_inference) (haven't bought an infrared remote for the pi to control a TV yet), where it mutes the TV/laptop when advertisements are on.
